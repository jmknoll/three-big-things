## Three Big Things

Three big things is an opinionated system to help you get more done. At the beginning of every day, and at the beginning of every week, you write down three things that you want to achieve. That's it.

### Why Three?

Three is a magic number. Its a small enough number that the tasks are significant, but its a large enough number that the tasks are manageable. What you're planning on doing with a whole day can be an overwhelming thought, but what you're planning on doing with 1/3 of a day is much easier to wrap your head around.

### How to Start?

Get started by thinking of three things that you want to achieve this week. No more, no less. If you have more than three, than you need to further prioritize them, or revisit the scope of the tasks. Then do the same thing for today. Then visit the website and simply input your tasks and mark them off as you complete them.
